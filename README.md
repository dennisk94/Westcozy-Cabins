## Overview

The Capstone Project is a custom WordPress website that we created with a team of 4 for a fictional vacation cabin rental service. The theme was fully customized using the Underscores starter theme. In a span of 5 weeks, our team actively took part in the researching, planning, developing, designing, and deployment of the website.
